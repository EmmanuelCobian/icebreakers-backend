<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Many technologies fail to prioritize or protect the unique needs of immigrants and underrepresented communities. Ice-Breakers seeks to bridge this gap by offering a tailored emergency support system that is multilingual, intuitive, and built with love.

Key features include:

- A panic button that notifies relatives and local rapid response networks
- A multilingual Red Card feature for use in interactions when having an encounter with ICE
- Contact information for immigration support nearby using the userâ€™s zip code
